# class-project
Small project that we had to do for our PHP class in school in 2021. Page was created using Bootstrap.

Page contains:
- guestbook with connection to MySQL database
- gallery with photos created using jQuery script called 'Magnific Popup'
- contact page with Google Maps pointing to my address, unfortunately contact form is not working due to hosting limitations
